  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne:
    "Hello and welcome! My name is Noah Turner. I am a Fullstack Software Engineer from Chicago, Illinois and currently a Software Developer Consultant.",
  aboutParaTwo:
  "I started my journey as a Software Engineer in 2019 when I was introduced to the world of coding through a friend. I was instantly intrigued by the idea of creating something from nothing. I began my journey by learning HTML, CSS, and the architecture behind an accessible web app. I continued on to JavaScript and turned those static pages into dynamic websites. During the pandemic, I enrolled in Thinkful's Full Stack Software Engineering Program. Through their structured and fast pace course, I advanced my skills into Full Stack Development by understanding back-end development with NodeJS and database creation/ maintenance with PostgreSQL. After graduating Thinkful's program, I joined the Chicago Artist Guide as a volunteer dev in order to gain real world experience and solidify my skills.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "As an engineer for Bitovi, I have worked on teams for Fortune 500 companies, e-commerce, authorization. I have held and run multiple meetups for the JavaScript community. I am infatuated with the world of software engineering and I want to help you bring your ideas to fruition. ",
